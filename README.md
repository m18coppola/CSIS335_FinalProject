# CSIS355_FinalProject

# Proposal:
We would like to make a raytracer to create 3d animations. We will use pthreads to parallelize the rendering of a frame, and OpenMPI to parallelize the rendering of each frame.

Our minimal expectations to use this nested parallelization structure to create a tool to render animations. With this, we should be able to render something simple, such as a mandelbrot zoom.

Ideally, we use this system to render 3d animations using raytracing techniques.
